This file describes communication between master (a PC transceiver) and remote keypad devices. Message type Id's for query and for response are the same.

Communication is allways initiated by master as broadcast, then responses may be send by individual keypads, and confirmation receipts are send to particular keypads. 
Keypads, if no receipt received, should retry tansmission after random time of channel idle, until time-out.

Maximum allowed message content size is 255 bytes.

There are following packet types:
0x01: RegisteredDevices
All operational keypad devices should respond providing their Id's
0x02: NewDevice
The message allows register of single device. Master sends a new device Id as content, and display its CRC, which should be entered on keypad. 
This Id will persist in device and will be used in subsequent communication, and confirmation is send to master as usual.
Keypads with non-zero Id's should not respond.
0x03: DropDevice
This message drops (zeroes) Id of device after confirmation on keypad. The response is however send with deleted Id.
0x04: StartVoting
Enables voting mode for all devices. After enabled, until EndVoting, devices sends keypad numbers. 
The sending retries with the same number until keypad number changed or transmission confirmed.
The content is displayed on device's screens
0x05: EndVoting
Finishes voting mode for all devices.
The content is displayed on devices screens
0x06: Display
Only displays text on devices screens

Broadcast (initiating the communication) packet structure is as follows:
byte index		size		meaning
0				1			SOH (0x1)
1				1			Packet type
2				1			Content length
4+				length		The content
last-1			2			Packet CRC (from byte index 1 until this)

Keypad responses
byte index		size		meaning
0				1			SOH (0x1)
1				1			Packet type || 0x80
2				16			Sender Id
18				2			Message Id
20				1			Response length
21				length		The response
last-1			2			Packet CRC

Confirmations (send by master to specified keypad)
byte index		size		meaning
0				1			SOH (0x1)
1				1			Packet type || 0xC0
2				16			Receiver Id
18				2			confirmed message Id
20				2			Packet CRC
